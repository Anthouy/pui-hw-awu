        If you’re going to design for mobile, you’re going to need to consider the way that the device is used and the specifics of the device itself.
        There are some general principles that can help designers for mobile get started but don’t forget that these don’t replace the need for user research.
        They are guidelines, not hard and fast rules.

        In the design thinking process, designers will often start creating personas during the second phase, the Define phase.
        In the Define phase, Design Thinkers synthesize their research and findings from the very first phase, the Empathise phase.
        Using personas is just one method, among others, that can help designers move on to the third phase, the Ideation phase.
        The personas will be used as a guide for ideation sessions such as Brainstorm, Worst Possible Idea and SCAMPER.

      Personas provide meaningful archetypes which you can use to assess your design development against.
      Constructing personas will help you ask the right questions and answer those questions in line with the users you are designing for.
      For example, “How would Peter, Joe, and Jessica experience, react, and behave in relation to feature X or change Y within the given context?” and
      “What do Peter, Joe, and Jessica think, feel, do and say?” and “What are their underlying needs we are trying to fulfill?”

  <h3 class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">Four Different Types of Personas</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
      In her Interaction Design Foundation encyclopedia article, Personas, Ph.D. and specialist in personas, Lene Nielsen,
      describes four perspectives that your personas can take to ensure that they add the most value to your design project and the fiction-based perspective. Let’s take a look at each of them:
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="articletextcontainer">
  <div class="col-md-1">
    <div class="articlelistcontainer">
      <h1 class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">1 | Goal-Directed Personas</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
      This persona cuts straight to the nitty-gritty. “It focusses on: What does my typical user want to do with my product?”.
      The objective of a goal-directed persona is to examine the process and workflow that your user would prefer to utilize to achieve their goals in interacting with your product or service.
      There is an implicit assumption that you have already done enough user research to recognize that your product has value to the user and that by examining their goals,you can bring their requirements to life.
      The goal-directed personas are based upon the perspectives of Alan Cooper, an American software designer and programmer who is widely recognized as the “Father of Visual Basic.”

<div class="articletextcontainer">
  <div class="col-md-1">
    <div class="articlelistcontainer">
      <h1 class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">2 | Role-Based Personas</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
      The role-based perspective is also goal-directed, and it also focuses on behavior.
      The personas of the role-based perspectives are massively data-driven and incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative sources.
      The role-based perspective focuses on the user’s role in the organization. In some cases, our designs need to reflect upon the part that our users play in their organizations or wider lives.
      An examination of the roles that our users typically play in real life can help inform better product design decisions.
      Where will the product be used? What’s this role’s purpose? What business objectives are required of this role? Who else is impacted by the duties of this role? What functions are served by this role?
      Jonathan Grudin, John Pruitt, and Tamara Adlin are advocates for the role-based perspective.

<div class="articletextcontainer">
  <div class="col-md-1">
    <div class="articlelistcontainer">
      <h1 class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">3 | Engaging Personas</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
      Engaging personas can incorporate both goal and role-directed personas, as well as the more traditional rounded personas.
      These engaging personas are designed so that the designers who use them can become more engaged with them. The idea is to create a 3D rendering of a user through the use of personas.
      The more people engage with the persona and see them as ’real’, the more likely they will be to consider them during the process design and want to serve them with the best product.
      These personas examine the emotions of the user, their psychology, backgrounds and make them relevant to the task at hand. The perspective emphasizes how stories can engage and bring the personas to life.
      One of the advocates for this perspective is Lene Nielsen.

      One of the main difficulties of the persona method is getting participants to use it (Browne, 2011).

      <h1 class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">4 | Fictional Personas</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-3">
    <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
      The fictional persona does not emerge from user research (unlike the other personas), but it emerges from the experience of the UX design team.
      It requires the team to make assumptions based upon past interactions with the user base and products to deliver a picture of what, perhaps, typical users look like.
      There’s no doubt that these personas can be deeply flawed (and there are endless debates on just how flawed). You may be able to use them as an initial sketch of user needs.
      They allow for early involvement with your users in the UX design process, but they should not, of course, be trusted as a guide for your development of products or services.

      This engaging persona method is directed at creating scenarios that describe solutions.
      For this purpose, you should describe a number of specific situations that could trigger the use of the product or service you are designing.
      In other words, situations are the basis of a scenario. You can give each of your personas life by creating scenarios that feature them in the role of a user.
      Scenarios usually start by placing the persona in a specific context with a problem they want to or have to solve.

      It is a common thread throughout all 10 steps that the goal of the method is to involve the project participants.
      As such, as many team members as possible should participate in the development of the personas, and it is important to obtain the acceptance and recognition of the participants of the various steps.
      In order to achieve this, you can choose between two strategies: You can ask the participants for their opinion, or you can let them participate actively in the process.

      In order for the participants to use the method, the persona descriptions should be disseminated to all.
      It is important to decide early on how you want to disseminate this knowledge to those who have not participated directly in the process, to future new employees, and to possible external partners.
      The dissemination of knowledge also includes how the project participants will be given access to the underlying data.

      The last step is the future life of the persona descriptions. You should revise the descriptions on a regular basis. New information and new aspects may affect the descriptions.
      Sometimes you would need to rewrite the existing persona descriptions, add new personas, or eliminate outdated personas.
