            I work for a video-streaming service with a monthly subscription model (similar to Netflix).
            A few months ago we ran a survey with a group of users who’d cancelled the service.
            We asked about satisfaction across three product areas: usability, content (videos), and access (can you access the service on your preferred devices).
            The results were surprising. Even users who’d canceled the service rated their satisfaction high in all three areas.
            And their overall satisfaction with the service was rated just as high. Needless to say, we were perplexed.
            Why would someone cancel a service with which they were highly satisfied?

            Kahneman, a psychologist and Nobel Laureate in economics, dedicates a significant portion of his book to examining the psychological underpinnings of how people make decisions.
            The part that struck me specifically was his discussion of the way an object’s utility impacts our desire to have it — and, ultimately, how it impacts our satisfaction.
        </p>

<div class="articletextcontainer">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <p class="animated delay-03s fadeInDown wow">
            The utility of an object is defined as its perceived ability to satisfy a need or desire.
            The more utility a person perceives something to have, the more satisfying it is for them.
            Kahneman explains this from an economic perspective:

            A gift of 10 [dollars] has the same utility to someone who already has 100 [dollars] as a gift of 20 [dollars] to someone whose current wealth is 200 [dollars].
            We normally speak of changes of income in terms of percentages, as when we say “she got a 30% raise.”
            The idea is that a 30% raise may evoke a fairly similar psychological response for the rich and for the poor, which an increase of $100 will not do.

            To extrapolate, a gift of $10 has less utility (and satisfaction) to a person who already has $200 than it does to someone who only has $100.
            The basic concept is that everyone who is considering purchasing a product weighs its perceived utility against its cost.
            If the utility seems high enough to justify the cost, the consumer is more likely to buy.

            This is where things get interesting.
            The original idea, put forth by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, emphasizing the role of utility in decision making is actually flawed.
            It assumes that it is the inherent utility of an object that makes a person more or less satisfied — that if you and I both have $100 we will be equally satisfied based on the inherent value of $100.
            As Kanheman shows, this assumption is wrong:

            We’re making the same mistake Bernoulli did over 200 years ago.
            What we’ve found is that, often, people are satisfied with the product but changes in their life situation have temporarily decreased its perceived utility.
            That decrease shifts the utility vs. cost equation in their minds.

        You don’t have as much screen real estate for mobile devices as you do for PCs and laptops.
        That means, normally, you’ll be designing for multiple screen sizes.
        Remember, you want to focus on a “mobile first” approach which means designing for the smallest mobile platforms and increasing complexity from there.
        A good process to follow would be:

            Using a task-first approach can help guarantee that you’re putting the main task up front.
            Think of it as an urgency issue. In this example, the context is school shootings in America (a big social problem that sadly occurs frequently in the United States).
            Notice how the primary “panic button” is featured above all other tasks and takes a stronger priority on screen.

            Mobile is different from the traditional desktop environment and while you use standard UX and usability considerations, the mobile environment brings new design considerations.
            It’s important for mobile designers to pay attention to the details in order to deliver the best possible user experiences.
            It is also important to respect a user’s attention and focus and minimize interruptions.
